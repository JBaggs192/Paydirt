Hello!
This is an app for playing the classic board game "Paydirt".
Currently, it is an html/css/js app that is deployed via Azure Static Web Apps (through a GitHub connector) - 
I am working on getting live multiplayer sessions created (ie a room code for live playing) but Azure App Service is a bit pricey so I'm probably going to have to host that from an on-prem server.
